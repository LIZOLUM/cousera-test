            They turned a suitcase full of clothes
            into a life and regular paychecks
            to make sure that children of immigrants
            wouldn't hate them for being the children of immigrants
            They worked too hard - you can tell by their hands,
            their eyes are begging for sleep
            but our mouths were begging to be fed
            and that is the most artistic thing I have ever seen.
            It is poetry to these ears that has never heard
            what passion sounds like
            and my mouth is full of likes and uhms
            when I look at their masterpiece
            â€˜coz there are no words in the English language
            that can articulate that kind of beauty.

            I can't compact their existence into 26 letters and call it a description
            I tried once but the adjectives needed to describe them don't even exist
            so I ended up with pages and pages full of words
            followed with commas and more words and more comas
            only to realize that there are some things in the world
            so infinite that they can never use a full stop.
